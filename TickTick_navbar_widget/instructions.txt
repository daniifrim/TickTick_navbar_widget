	1.	We are creating a Mac menu bar app for task tracking.
	2.	It looks like Wdiget_mockup.png
	3.	The menu bar displays the current task title and the time remaining.
	4.	The app connects to the TickTick API to fetch tasks.
	5.	If a task is upcoming, it shows “Task Title - in Xh Xm.”
	6.	If a task is due soon, it shows “Task Title - Xm left.”
	7.	The app updates dynamically based on the nearest task’s due time.
	8.	The menu bar text automatically refreshes as time passes.
	9.	The task display should adjust to account for changes in task times from the API.
	10.	Complete this app in its entirety.
